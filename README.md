# Swiftly SWAPI

This is a demo project for a job application to Lithia.

The app has the pages and functionality as described in the pdf and the comps. I added APIs for both the services and appointments, and used the arrays together to dynamically fetch and output based off of the service ID. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers,

Paul
